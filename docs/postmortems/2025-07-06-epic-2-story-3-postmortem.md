# Postmortem Report: Story epic-2-story-3 - Polymarket-ZetaChain Integration

**Date:** 2025-07-06

**Authors:** Metis (System Auditor)

## 1. Summary

The story `epic-2-story-3` was escalated after multiple development cycles failed to pass validation. The root cause was a systemic failure to adhere to established protocols for Quality Assurance, Security, and Dependency Management. Development commenced before critical dependencies like API credentials were in place, and mandatory QA checks (Semgrep, load testing, penetration testing) were bypassed entirely. This resulted in an incomplete and insecure implementation that was correctly rejected by the validation process.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

*   **Protocol Bypass:** The development process was initiated without ensuring all dependencies were met, as evidenced by the unchecked "Polymarket API credentials added to Vault" in both the story definition ([`docs/stories/epic-2-story-3-poly-zetachain-integration.md`](docs/stories/epic-2-story-3-poly-zetachain-integration.md:33)) and the final validation report ([`docs/validation/epic-2-story-3-validation-report.md`](docs/validation/epic-2-story-3-validation-report.md:35)). This violates the principle of dependency-first development.
*   **QA Protocol Non-Compliance:** The validation report ([`docs/validation/epic-2-story-3-validation-report.md`](docs/validation/epic-2-story-3-validation-report.md:53-56)) confirms a complete failure to execute the mandatory MCP verification steps outlined in the [`QA Protocol v2.0`](docs/architecture/qa_protocol.md:37). Specifically, Semgrep scans and other required checks were not performed.
*   **Security Standard Negligence:** The failure to securely manage API credentials points to a disregard for the [`Security Standards`](docs/architecture/security-standards.md:11) document, which explicitly forbids insecure handling of secrets.

## 3. Impact

*   **Wasted Development Cycles:** Significant developer time was wasted on a feature that was fundamentally un-releasable.
*   **Increased Project Risk:** Bypassing security and QA protocols introduced significant security and operational risk into the project.
*   **Erosion of Process Integrity:** The failure to enforce established protocols undermines the integrity of the entire development process.

## 4. Lessons Learned

*   Protocols are ineffective without strict, automated enforcement.
*   Dependency verification must be a blocking prerequisite for development.
*   QA and security checks cannot be optional or deferred.

## 5. Action Items & System Improvement Proposal

To prevent recurrence, the following improvements to the system's core protocols are proposed. These changes are designed to be implemented by `@bmad-master` to enforce compliance at a systemic level.

# System Improvement Proposal

**Submitted by:** Metis (System Auditor)
**Date:** 2025-07-06

The following modifications are proposed to the core system protocols to ensure mandatory compliance with established standards.

### 1. Enforce Dependency Checklist in Story Definition

**File to Modify:** `docs/stories/story-tmpl.md` (and all agents responsible for story creation/transition)

**Proposed Change:** Add a mandatory, blocking "Definition of Ready" checklist to the story template. An agent may not transition a story to "active" or "development" status until all items are checked.

**New Section to Add to `docs/stories/story-tmpl.md`:**

```markdown
## Definition of Ready
- [ ] All external dependencies (APIs, credentials) are identified and accessible.
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are testable.
- [ ] QA validation plan is documented.
- [ ] Security review of the story has been completed.
```

### 2. Integrate Automated QA Checks into Agent Workflow

**File to Modify:** `docs/architecture/qa_protocol.md`

**Proposed Change:** The QA protocol must be updated to specify that the responsible agent (e.g., `@bmad-dev` or `@bmad-qa`) MUST execute the MCP verification checks and attach the resulting log file to the pull request or commit message.

**Modification to `docs/architecture/qa_protocol.md`:**

**Replace lines 53-56:**
```markdown
53 | 2. GitHub code search validation for pattern matching
54 | 3. Brave-search API documentation checks
55 | 4. Full MCP verification log stored in `.ai/mcp_checks/`
```

**With:**
```markdown
2. **Mandatory Execution:** The agent responsible for completing the development task MUST execute the `semgrep`, `github code search`, and `brave-search` MCP checks.
3. **Evidence of Compliance:** The output logs from these checks MUST be saved to `.ai/mcp_checks/<story_id>-<timestamp>.log`.
4. **Gating Mechanism:** A pull request will be blocked from merging if this log file is not present and does not indicate a "pass" status on all required checks.
```

### 3. Strengthen Security Protocol Enforcement

**File to Modify:** `docs/architecture/security-standards.md`

**Proposed Change:** Add a specific clause about a "Secure Vault Check" to the secrets management section.

**New text to add after line 14 in `docs/architecture/security-standards.md`:**

```markdown
-   **Vault Verification:** Before initiating development on a story, the assigned agent MUST verify that all required secrets are present in the designated secure vault. This check must be logged as a prerequisite in the agent's operational report.
