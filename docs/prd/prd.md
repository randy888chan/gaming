## 3. Monetization Strategy
*Goal: To establish a fair, competitive, and profitable revenue model that leverages our unique omnichain convenience.*

- **Gamba Games Platform Fee:** **2.5%**
  - **Justification:** This fee is positioned competitively within the standard 1-4% range for GambleFi platforms. It reflects the premium, seamless experience of using assets from any chain without bridging.

- **Polymarket Convenience Fee:** **0.15%**
  - **Justification:** Applied to the total trade volume for bets initiated through our platform. This is a micro-fee for the unique value proposition of making Polymarket accessible to non-EVM users (e.g., placing bets with Solana or TON assets), a service unavailable anywhere else.
