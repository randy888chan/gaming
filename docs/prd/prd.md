## Product Requirements Document: Quantum Nexus (v2.0)

### 1. Vision & Strategy

*   **Vision:** To create a "flash and viral" decentralized application (dApp) that unifies Web3 gaming and prediction markets into a single, seamless user experience, deployed on a lean, cost-effective infrastructure.
*   **Core Problem:** The Web3 landscape is fragmented. Users need to switch between platforms (and chains) for different activities. Onboarding is often complex for newcomers.
*   **Strategic Foundation:** This project is an evolution of the open-source `Gamba-V2-Next.js` platform, enhancing it with unique omnichain and AI-driven capabilities.

### 2. Core Features & User Epics

This outlines the primary capabilities of the platform.

#### **Epic 1: The Unified Gameplay Experience**
*   **Gamba Game Suite:** Integrate the full suite of Gamba V2 games with a consistent UI.
*   **Polymarket Prediction Markets:** Create a seamless interface within the dApp to browse, view, and place bets on Polymarket events. Users should not feel like they are leaving our platform.
*   **Omnichain Abstraction (Powered by ZetaChain):** Users must be able to use assets from one chain (e.g., an EVM chain) to interact with protocols on another (e.g., Solana for Gamba games) without performing manual bridging. ZetaChain will handle this complex cross-chain logic in the background.

#### **Epic 2: Frictionless Onboarding & Viral Growth**
*   **Social Login (Powered by Particle Network):** New users must be able to sign up and get a self-custodial wallet using their social accounts (Google, X, etc.) to eliminate the friction of seed phrases.
*   **First Play Free:** To incentivize trial, new users will receive a one-time, micro-value credit upon signup.
*   **AI-Powered Viral Content Loop:**
    *   **Programmatic SEO (pSEO):** An LLM-powered service will automatically generate SEO-optimized landing pages based on trending games or Polymarket events to capture organic search traffic.
    *   **Social Media Automation:** A backend worker will automatically post links to the newly generated pSEO content and other platform events (e.g., big wins, new tournaments) to social media channels like X/Twitter.

#### **Epic 3: Enhanced User Engagement**
*   **Tournament Engine:** A backend system to create, manage, and display single-elimination tournaments for supported games.
*   **Smart Bet AI:** A user-facing feature that provides simple, AI-powered bet suggestions to increase engagement and user confidence.

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements (Mandatory)

*   **Deployment & Infrastructure:** The entire application stack **must** be designed for and deployed on the **Cloudflare** ecosystem (Pages, Workers, D1, R2). This is a non-negotiable architectural constraint.
*   **Localization:** The UI must be architected for localization and support at least 10 languages (`en`, `es`, `fr`, `de`, `it`, `pt`, `ru`, `zh`, `ja`, `ko`). An LLM can be used to generate the initial translations.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** The infrastructure must be designed to operate within free or near-zero cost tiers initially, scaling predictably as usage grows.

### 4. Current Status & Next Steps

*   **Current Status:** **Refactoring & Realignment**. The project has completed an initial proof-of-concept phase. Due to fragmented documentation, development has been paused to realign on this core vision. Significant code and documentation assets exist but must be audited against this PRD.
*   **Immediate Next Steps:**
    1.  **Approve This PRD:** This document must be accepted as the new source of truth.
    2.  **Architectural Realignment:** The System Architect (`@architect`) will produce a new, streamlined architecture document based on this PRD.
    3.  **Backlog Grooming:** All existing stories and epics must be re-evaluated, and a new, clean backlog created based on the epics defined above.
