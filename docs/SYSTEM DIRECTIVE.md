### **SYSTEM DIRECTIVE: 20250707-B (CONSOLIDATED)**
**PROJECT:** Quantum Nexus
**STATUS:** ACTIVE - PHASE 1
**AUTHORITY:** Chief Orchestrator (Saul)

This document, Directive 20250707-B, is the **single source of truth** for Project Quantum Nexus. It is immutable and not subject to creative interpretation. All agents, without exception, are bound by the articles herein.

### **Article I: The Prime Directive**

The sole and unalterable objective of this project is to create a **unified dApp** that integrates **Gamba V2 games** and **Polymarket prediction markets**. This dApp **WILL** be built upon the `Gamba-V2-Next.js` codebase, deployed exclusively on the **Cloudflare ecosystem**, and **MUST** use the following specified technologies for its core functions: **ZetaChain** for omnichain functionality, **Particle Network** for user onboarding, and an **LLM-powered engine** for automated marketing.

There will be no deviation from this directive.

### **Article II: The Unbreakable Commandments**

These six commandments are the non-negotiable pillars of the project. They define *what* we are building.

#### **I. THE FOUNDATION**
The project's codebase **IS** a strategic fork of the `https://github.com/BankkRoll/Gamba-V2-Next.js.git` repository. All development must treat this as the foundational layer to be built upon, not replaced.

#### **II. THE ECOSYSTEM**
The entire application stack **MUST** be designed for and deployed on **Cloudflare**.
*   **Hosting & Frontend:** Cloudflare Pages
*   **Backend & APIs:** Cloudflare Workers
*   **Database:** Cloudflare D1 (SQL)
*   **Asset Storage:** Cloudflare R2
No other cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Vercel, Firebase) will be used for these core functions.

#### **III. THE CORE INTEGRATIONS**
The project has critical, mandatory external service and blockchain integrations:
1.  **Particle Network:** This **IS** the exclusive service for user onboarding, social login, and wallet creation. It **MUST** provide self-custodial wallets for EVM, Solana, and **TON**.
2.  **ZetaChain:** This **IS** the omnichain layer. All cross-chain transactions and messaging between EVM, Solana, and **TON** **MUST** be routed through ZetaChain's contracts. The TON integration is a mandatory component.
3.  **Polymarket:** This **IS** the exclusive source for all prediction market data and interactions.

#### **IV. THE AI ENGINE**
The system **MUST** include two specific LLM-powered features running as Cloudflare Workers:
1.  **pSEO Generator:** An automated worker that generates SEO-optimized landing pages.
2.  **Social Poster:** An automated worker that posts links to new content and platform events to social media.

#### **V. THE GLOBAL REACH**
The user interface **MUST** be built to support localization for the following ten languages: `en`, `es`, `fr`, `de`, `it`, `pt`, `ru`, `zh`, `ja`, `ko`. The initial translations will be generated by an LLM.

#### **VI. THE PLATFORM FORM FACTOR**
The application **MUST** be architected to meet the following deployment targets. These are not optional extras; they are primary goals.
1.  **Progressive Web App (PWA):** The application **MUST** be a fully installable PWA, complete with a service worker and a comprehensive `manifest.webmanifest`.
2.  **Telegram Mini App (TMA):** The application **MUST** be fully compatible and deployable as a Telegram Mini App, integrating with the Telegram Web App SDK.

### **Article III: The Implementation Protocol (Roadmap)**

This is the mandatory, sequential plan for *how* the project will be built. No phase begins until the previous one is complete and validated.

#### **Phase 1: Foundational Refactoring & Core Service Implementation (CURRENT PHASE)**
**Objective:** Stabilize the foundation and implement critical backend services. All other work is halted.
1.  **Code & Contract Audit:** Audit all existing code for compliance with this directive.
2.  **Fix Core Contracts:** The `PolymarketAdapter.sol` contract must be fixed, tested, and validated for full compatibility with ZetaChain.
3.  **Implement Service Adapters:** Build and/or refactor the backend service adapters in `src/services/` for ZetaChain, Polymarket, and the AI Engine.
4.  **Finalize Database Schema:** The `infra/d1/schema.sql` file must be updated to support all features defined in this directive (Tournaments, Users, pSEO Content, etc.).

#### **Phase 2: Core Feature Implementation**
**Objective:** Build the primary user-facing features on the stable foundation.
1.  **Onboarding & Wallets:** Implement the full social login flow using Particle Network (including TON) and the "First Play Free" credit system.
2.  **Polymarket UI:** Build the frontend components to display and interact with Polymarket markets.
3.  **Tournament UI:** Build the frontend components for the Tournament Engine.
4.  **PWA & TMA Configuration:** Finalize the configurations required for both PWA installation and Telegram Mini App deployment.

#### **Phase 3: AI Growth Engine Activation**
**Objective:** Build and activate the automated marketing features.
1.  **Implement pSEO Worker:** Create and deploy the Cloudflare Worker for generating SEO content.
2.  **Implement Social Poster Worker:** Create and deploy the Cloudflare Worker for automated social media posting.

### **Article IV: Concluding Mandate**

This directive is absolute. All prior Product Requirements Documents, Architecture Documents, proposals, and amendments are hereby declared **null and void**. There is no other plan. All agents will now proceed according to this document, beginning with the remaining tasks in **Phase 1**.
