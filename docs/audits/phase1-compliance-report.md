# Phase 1 Compliance Report: SYSTEM DIRECTIVE 20250707-B

**Audit Date:** 2025-07-07
**Auditor:** Metis, System Auditor

## 1. Executive Summary

This audit reveals **critical non-compliance** across the `src/`, `contracts/`, and `docs/` directories. The existing codebase is fundamentally misaligned with the mandatory requirements of **SYSTEM DIRECTIVE 20250707-B**. The project, in its current state, fails to meet the foundational requirements of Phase 1 and requires immediate, significant remediation.

The most critical issues are:
*   **Lack of Multi-Chain Support:** The mandatory TON and Solana integrations are completely absent from both the smart contracts and the off-chain services.
*   **Non-Production-Ready Code:** Core components contain placeholder logic, testnet configurations, and simulated implementations that are unsuitable for a production environment.
*   **Incomplete and Flawed Architecture:** The database schema and service layers lack the necessary components to support the directive's core features.

## 2. Detailed Findings

### 2.1. Smart Contracts (`contracts/`)

| File | Finding | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PolymarketAdapter.sol` | **Major Compliance Issue:** Lacks mandatory TON integration. | Critical |
| `PolymarketAdapter.sol` | **High-Risk Issue:** `placeBet` function contains non-production simulation code. | High |
| `PolymarketAdapter.sol` | **Efficiency Issue:** `onZetaMessage` function inefficiently decodes the message payload multiple times. | Medium |

### 2.2. Infrastructure (`infra/`)

| File | Finding | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `d1/schema.sql` | **Major Compliance Issue:** Missing critical tables for Polymarket market data and ZetaChain transaction logging. | Critical |
| `d1/schema.sql` | **Architectural Flaw:** `user_preferences` table is keyed by `walletAddress`, which is not a sustainable approach for a multi-chain system. | High |

### 2.3. Services (`src/services/`)

| File | Finding | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `polymarketService.ts` | **High-Risk Issue:** Relies on placeholder interfaces and best-guess implementations. | High |
| `polymarketService.ts` | **Architectural Flaw:** Lacks write-based functions for betting and market interaction. | High |
| `zetaChainService.ts` | **Major Compliance Issue:** Lacks mandatory TON and Solana integration. | Critical |
| `zetaChainService.ts` | **High-Risk Issue:** Configured exclusively for the Athens testnet and relies on placeholder signer implementations. | High |

## 3. Remediation Plan

The following actions are required to bring the project into compliance with Phase 1 of the System Directive:

1.  **Refactor `PolymarketAdapter.sol`:**
    *   Implement the TON and Solana integrations.
    *   Replace the simulation logic in `placeBet` with production-ready code.
    *   Optimize the `onZetaMessage` function to decode the message payload only once.
2.  **Refactor `infra/d1/schema.sql`:**
    *   Add tables for Polymarket market data and ZetaChain transaction logging.
    *   Modify the `user_preferences` table to be keyed by a unified `particle_user_id`.
3.  **Refactor `polymarketService.ts`:**
    *   Replace the placeholder interfaces and implementations with production-ready code.
    *   Implement write-based functions for betting and market interaction.
4.  **Refactor `zetaChainService.ts`:**
    *   Implement the TON and Solana integrations.
    *   Replace the testnet configurations and placeholder signer implementations with production-ready code.

## 4. Conclusion

The project is not compliant with **SYSTEM DIRECTIVE 20250707-B**. The remediation plan outlined above must be implemented immediately to ensure the successful completion of Phase 1.
