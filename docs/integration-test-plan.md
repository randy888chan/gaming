*   Core Game Mechanics and Gameplay Loop
*   Wallet and Token Interactions
*   Chat Functionality
*   Referral System
*   Polymarket Integration
*   Recent Plays/History
*   API Interactions
*   UI/UX and Responsiveness

## 3. Objectives
*   Verify the correct data flow and communication between integrated components.
*   Identify interface defects and integration issues.
*   Ensure that cross-feature interactions behave as expected.
*   Validate system behavior under various edge cases and failure scenarios.
*   Confirm that the platform meets the specified functional and non-functional requirements.

## 4. Test Environment
