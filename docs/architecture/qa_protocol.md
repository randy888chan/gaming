# Quality Assurance Protocol

## Testing Requirements
- 95% branch coverage for cross-chain logic
- Load test ZetaChain integrations at 500 TPS
- Fuzz testing for EVM contracts using Echidna
- Penetration testing for all API endpoints

## Audit Trails
1. All production deploys require Chainlink Proof of Reserve
2. Cross-chain transactions must log to IPFS
3. Smart contract deploys include Bytecode Hash Registry entries

## Release Gates
- Zero critical SonarCloud vulnerabilities
- All P1/P2 bugs resolved
- Performance baseline metrics met
