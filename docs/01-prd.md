# Product Requirements Document: Quantum Nexus

## 1. Project Overview

Quantum Nexus is a universal decentralized application (dApp) that unifies the fragmented landscape of decentralized gaming and prediction markets. It solves the high friction and technical barriers in the current dApp ecosystem by integrating premier platforms like Gamba (Solana) and Polymarket (EVM) into a single, fluid user experience orchestrated by ZetaChain. The core innovations are radical simplicity through Particle Network's social login Wallet-as-a-Service, and an AI-driven "Smart Bet" and viral growth engine to drive user acquisition and engagement.

## 2. User Stories

- As a new user, I want to sign up with my social account so that I can access the platform without needing to manage a crypto wallet myself.
- As a new user who just signed up, I want to receive a "First Play Free" credit so that I can try a game immediately without any risk.
- As a user, I want to see and play all available Gamba games within the new "Hyperspace Gateway" interface so that I have a variety of gaming options.
- As a user playing a Gamba game, I want a "Smart Bet" button that gives me a simple, AI-powered bet suggestion so that I can play with more confidence.
- As a user, I want to browse and view active prediction markets from Polymarket so that I can find opportunities to bet on.
- As a user, I want to connect my EVM wallet and place a bet on a Polymarket market so that I can participate in prediction markets.
- As a user, I want to see my open positions and a history of my past bets on Polymarket so that I can track my performance.
- As a user, I want to be rewarded for bringing friends to the platform and easily share my exciting wins so that I can benefit from growing the community.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Cost-Effectiveness:** All infrastructure must be designed to operate within free or near-zero-cost tiers for the first 6 months.
- **Performance (Time to Wow):** The time from a user landing on the page to their first on-chain interaction must be under 3 minutes.
- **Performance (UI):** All primary UI animations and page transitions must maintain a consistent 60 FPS on modern devices.
- **Scalability:** The pSEO engine must be architected to scale to thousands of pages without a significant increase in manual oversight or cost.
- **Modularity:** The core architecture must support planned post-MVP integrations (e.g., THORChain) without requiring a major refactor.
- **Resilience:** A caching layer must be implemented for Polymarket data to ensure UI performance and handle external API downtime.
- **Strategic Localization:** The application UI must be translated for the following 10 languages to target key markets:
    - English (`en`)
    - Simplified Chinese (`zh`)
    - Japanese (`ja`)
    - Korean (`ko`)
    - Spanish (`es`)
