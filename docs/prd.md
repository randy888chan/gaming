# Product Requirements Document: Quantum Nexus

## 1. Vision & Goals

**Vision:** To create a universal decentralized application (dApp) that unifies the fragmented landscape of Web3 gaming and prediction markets into a single, seamless, and "flash and viral" user experience.

**Business Goals:**
-   Drive user acquisition through a frictionless onboarding process and viral referral loops.
-   Achieve high user engagement and retention via a superior, immersive UI/UX and unique AI-driven features.
-   Operate on a lean, cost-effective infrastructure to maximize profitability.

## 2. Target Audience

-   **Primary (Crypto-Native):** Experienced Web3 users who value efficiency and an omnichain hub to interact with multiple protocols (Gamba, Polymarket) without switching platforms.
-   **Secondary (Mainstream):** Newcomers to Web3 who are attracted by a simple, social-login onboarding process and require an intuitive, non-intimidating user experience.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
-   **Cost-Effectiveness:** All infrastructure must be designed to operate within free or near-zero-cost tiers for the first 6 months.
