# Epic 2 Story 3: Polymarket-ZetaChain Integration

**Status:** APPROVED  
**Priority:** P0  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Requirement Source:** [External Dependencies](docs/architecture/external-dependencies.md#L8)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement prediction market adapter supporting Polymarket API v3
2. Create cross-chain settlement system using ZetaChain's omnichain contracts
3. Deploy Cloudflare Workers for off-chain computation layer
4. Maintain 99.9% uptime SLA for settlement finality
5. Pass all security audits per QA protocol

## Technical Requirements
