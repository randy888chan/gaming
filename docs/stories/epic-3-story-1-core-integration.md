# Epic 3 - Story 1: Cross-Chain Settlement Engine Implementation

## User Story
As a blockchain gambler  
I want to seamlessly transfer assets between Ethereum and Solana  
So I can play games across chains without manual bridging  

## Technical Guidance
### Smart Contract Requirements
- Implement `CrossChainSettlement` contract from [architecture docs](#)
- Key functions:
  - `initiateSwap(uint256 amount, bytes32 targetChain)`
  - `confirmSwap(bytes32 swapId)`
  - `cancelSwap(bytes32 swapId)`

### Performance Targets
- Settlement time: <120s (P99)
- Throughput: 85 TPS per chain
- CCIP fee structure: 0.3% + gas costs

### Security Requirements
- Implement time-locked nonce system for replay protection
- Integrate Chainlink Price Feeds for cross-chain value parity
- Include Snyk vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline

### Key Dependencies
- Chainlink CCIP Router: 0xYourCCIPRouterAddress
- Web3Auth MPC Configuration: /config/web3auth-mpc.json
- Tenderly Monitoring Dashboard: https://dashboard.tenderly.co/your-project

## Acceptance Criteria
1. [ ] Users can initiate cross-chain swaps through wallet interface
2. [ ] Swaps complete within 120s with on-chain confirmation
3. [ ] System handles failed swaps with automatic refunds
4. [ ] All contracts pass Halborn audit checklist
5. [ ] Load testing shows 85 TPS capacity

## Testing Protocol
1. **Unit Tests**  
   - CCIP message validation
   - Fee calculation accuracy
   - Failed swap recovery

2. **Integration Tests**  
   - Mainnet <> Solana Devnet swaps
   - High volume stress test (10k concurrent users)

3. **Security Tests**  
   - MythX smart contract analysis
   - Cross-chain replay attack simulation

## Deployment Plan
**Phase 1 (W1)**  
- Deploy to Ethereum Goerli & Solana Devnet  
- Enable for 5% of users via feature flag  

**Phase 2 (W2)**  
- Monitor for 48h with gradual traffic increase  
- Full rollout after successful metrics:  
  - <2% failed transactions  
  - P99 latency <120s  

## Compliance Requirements
- Geo-block restricted jurisdictions using Cloudflare Ruleset
- TRM Labs transaction monitoring integration
- KYC checks via Mercuryo widget v3.2+
