# Story: Implement Tournament Management API Endpoints and Documentation

**Epic:** Establish Core Platform Functionality and User Onboarding

## User Story
As a platform administrator, I want the Tournament Management API to be fully functional with complete endpoints, finalized integration tests, and updated documentation, so that tournament creation and management can be reliably handled.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   All required endpoints for tournament management (e.g., create, read, update, delete tournaments, manage teams, manage matches) are implemented in `src/pages/api/v1/tournaments/`.
*   Integration tests for all implemented tournament management endpoints are finalized and passing in `tests/integration/tournament-management.test.ts`.
*   The API documentation in `project_docs/api-documentation.md` is updated to accurately reflect the implemented endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.

## Technical Guidance
*   **Backend API (`src/pages/api/v1/tournaments/`):**
    *   Implement CRUD operations for tournaments.
    *   Implement endpoints for managing tournament teams (add, remove, list).
    *   Implement endpoints for managing tournament matches (create, update status, list).
    *   Ensure proper request validation and error handling for all endpoints.
    *   Refer to `docs/architecture/database-schema.md` for data models.
    *   Adhere to `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` and `docs/architecture/security-standards.md`.
*   **Integration Tests (`tests/integration/tournament-management.test.ts`):**
    *   Write comprehensive integration tests covering all API endpoints.
    *   Ensure tests mock dependencies correctly and assert expected outcomes.
    *   Refer to `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md` for best practices.
*   **API Documentation (`project_docs/api-documentation.md`):**
    *   Document each endpoint with its HTTP method, path, request parameters (body, query, path), and response structure.
    *   Include examples for requests and responses.
    *   Specify authentication/authorization requirements.
