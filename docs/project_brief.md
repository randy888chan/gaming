# Database Schema Version Tracking Implementation

## 1. Problem Statement
The current database migration system lacks version tracking, making it difficult to:
- Determine which migrations have been applied to a database instance
- Roll back to previous schema versions
- Maintain consistency across development, staging, and production environments

## 2. Proposed Solution
Implement a robust schema version tracking system using industry best practices.

### 2.1 Key Components
1. **Version Table**: Create a `schema_version` table to track applied migrations
2. **Migration Script Standard**: Adopt consistent naming convention for migration files (V<version>__<description>.sql)
3. **Migration Tool**: Integrate FlywayDB for migration management (open-source, lightweight solution)

### 2.2 Technical Specifications
```sql
-- Schema version table structure
CREATE TABLE schema_version (
    version VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    script_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    checksum VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
    installed_by VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    installed_on TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    execution_time INTEGER NOT NULL,
    success BOOLEAN NOT NULL
);
```

### 2.3 Migration Process
1. Check `schema_version` table for last applied migration
2. Identify new migration scripts in `/migrations` directory
3. Apply migrations in sequential order
4. Record migration details in `schema_version` table

## 3. Constraints & Evidence

### 3.1 Technical Constraints
1. **Idempotent Migrations**: All scripts must be rerunnable without errors [Source: Enterprise Craftsmanship - https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/posts/database-versioning-best-practices]
2. **Atomic Changes**: Each migration must represent a single schema change [Source: Medium - https://medium.com/@vavasthi/database-schema-version-control-5c6dcb2550e7]
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Schema changes must maintain compatibility with previous versions during deployment [Source: GeeksforGeeks - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-schema-versioning-in-dbms/]

### 3.2 Operational Constraints
1. **Zero Downtime**: Migrations must support blue-green deployments
2. **Audit Trail**: All schema changes must be recorded with timestamp and executor
3. **Rollback Capability**: System must support reverting to previous schema versions

## 4. Implementation Plan
1. Rename existing migration to `V1__initial_schema.sql`
2. Create `V2__add_version_tracking.sql` to implement version table
3. Integrate FlywayDB (open-source version)
4. Implement migration runner script
5. Update CI/CD pipeline to run migrations automatically

## 5. Success Metrics
1. 100% of environments have identical schema versions
2. Migration history visible for all database instances
3. Average migration time under 30 seconds
4. Zero failed deployments due to schema mismatches
