# Project Brief: Quantum Nexus v2.0

**Document Status:** **ACTIVE & DEFINITIVE** | **Version:** 2.0 | **Date:** 2025-07-26

## 1. Vision
To build the definitive, viral "Super-App" that seamlessly integrates Web3 gaming and prediction markets, made accessible to all existing crypto holders through a radically simple user experience.

## 2. The Problem We Solve
The Web3 gaming and betting space is severely fragmented. A user's assets are siloed on different chains (Solana, EVM, TON), forcing them to navigate complex, expensive, and risky bridges to participate in different dApps. This friction is the single biggest barrier to market growth.

## 3. Our Solution & Competitive Edge
Quantum Nexus wins by delivering a unified, "Web2-like" experience that abstracts away all blockchain complexity. Our competitive edge is a technology trifecta:
-   **Particle Network:** For universal, social-first identity and session-based gameplay.
-   **ZetaChain:** For omnichain asset aggregation, allowing users to play and bet with any asset from any chain, without bridging.
-   **Cloudflare:** For a lean, infinitely scalable, and low-cost serverless infrastructure.

We are not just another dApp; we are the universal front-door to on-chain entertainment.

## 4. Target Audience
1.  **The Multi-Chain User:** Holds assets on multiple chains and is frustrated by the friction of moving them.
2.  **The Crypto-Native Social Gamer:** Active in Telegram/X communities and seeks immediate, low-barrier-to-entry dApp experiences.

## 5. Core Tenets (The Unbreakable Rules)
This project is governed by the principles outlined in `SYSTEM DIRECTIVE: 20250712-A (PHOENIX)`. Key mandates include:
-   **Foundation:** Built upon the `Gamba-V2-Next.js` codebase.
-   **Ecosystem:** Deployed exclusively on the Cloudflare serverless stack.
-   **Integrations:** Particle Network (Onboarding), ZetaChain (Omnichain), Polymarket (Prediction Markets) are the sole providers for their respective functions.
-   **Growth:** An AI-powered engine for automated pSEO and social media marketing is a required feature.
-   **Access:** The final product MUST be a PWA and fully TMA-compatible.

## 6. Monetization Strategy
-   **Gamba Games Platform Fee:** **2.5%** on wager amount.
-   **Polymarket Convenience Fee:** **0.15%** on total trade volume.

## 7. Path to Execution
-   The **Product Requirements Document** (`docs/prd/prd.md`) details *what* we are building.
-   The **Refined Execution Plan** (`docs/execution_blueprint.md`) details *how* we are building it, with a strict focus on security and stability first.
