## Outstanding Issues in `tests/integration/first-play-free.test.ts`

### Summary of Work Done:

1.  **Initial JWT Failures Addressed:**
    *   Corrected `jsonwebtoken` mocking strategy to ensure the API handler receives a valid `jwt.verify` function. This involved using `jest.mock` with a factory that provides a `default` export matching the API's `import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken'`.
    *   Refined `beforeEach` to use `jest.resetAllMocks()` and then explicitly re-apply default implementations for `jwt.verify`, `mockD1.prepare`, and `creditConfigService.getConfig`.
    *   Ensured tests expecting JWT success use `(jwt.verify as jest.Mock).mockReturnValueOnce(...)` with unique token strings for better isolation.
    *   The "401 test" (`should return 401 if JWT is invalid`) was re-enabled and uses `mockImplementationOnce` for its specific error case. This test now passes and initial console errors related to its mock bleeding into other tests are resolved.

2.  **D1 Database Mock Injection in API Handler:**
    *   Modified `src/pages/api/first-play-free.ts` to correctly use the D1 database instance injected via `(process.env as any).DB` when `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test'`. Previously, it was always using its own internal mock during tests.

### Current Blocking Issue: `TypeError: DB.prepare is not a function`

Despite the above fixes, the majority of tests are now failing with the error `TypeError: DB.prepare is not a function`. This error originates from the API handler (`src/pages/api/first-play-free.ts`) when it attempts to call `DB.prepare(...)`.

**Analysis of the Blocker:**

*   This error indicates that the `DB` object used by the API handler does not have a `prepare` method that is a function.
*   In the test setup (`tests/integration/first-play-free.test.ts`):
    *   `mockD1` is an object defined with `prepare: jest.fn()`.
    *   `beforeAll` sets `(process.env as any).DB = mockD1;`.
    *   `beforeEach` now includes `jest.resetAllMocks();` followed by `(process.env as any).DB = mockD1;` and then `(mockD1.prepare as jest.Mock).mockImplementation(...default D1 behavior...);`. This *should* ensure `DB.prepare` is a correctly implemented Jest mock function.
*   The API handler's logic correctly attempts to use `(process.env as any).DB` when `NODE_ENV === 'test'`.
*   The persistence of this error suggests a fundamental problem with the `DB` object received by the API handler. It's either not the `mockD1` instance from the test file, or `mockD1` is being altered in an unexpected way that removes/corrupts its `prepare` method. Common causes like Jest mock lifecycle issues have been extensively debugged with standard techniques (`resetAllMocks`, explicit re-implementation, `mockClear` vs `mockReset`).

**Hypotheses for `DB.prepare is not a function`:**

1.  **`process.env.DB` Not Propagating Correctly:** The `(process.env as any).DB` set in the test's `beforeAll`/`beforeEach` might not be the `process.env.DB` seen by the API handler when invoked via `supertest`. This could be due to Jest's environment virtualization, module caching, or specifics of the Next.js API testing setup.
2.  **`mockD1` Object Corruption:** The `mockD1` object itself, or its `prepare` property, might be getting corrupted or redefined unexpectedly between the test setup and the API handler execution.

**Recommended Next Diagnostic Steps for Human Developer:**

1.  **Verify `DB` Object in API Handler:**
    *   Temporarily add `console.log` statements inside `src/pages/api/first-play-free.ts` just before `DB.prepare()` is called:
        ```typescript
        // console.log('API Handler - process.env.DB:', (process.env as any).DB);
        // console.log('API Handler - DB_INSTANCE:', DB_INSTANCE);
        // console.log('API Handler - typeof DB.prepare:', typeof DB?.prepare);
        // if (DB) { console.log('API Handler - DB keys:', Object.keys(DB)); }
        ```
    *   Run a single failing test (e.g., `should grant first play free credit to a new user`) and observe these logs. This will show what `DB` actually is from the API's perspective.

2.  **Verify `mockD1` in Test File:**
    *   In a failing test in `tests/integration/first-play-free.test.ts`, just before `agent.post(...)`, log `mockD1` and `typeof mockD1.prepare`:
        ```typescript
        // console.log('Test File - mockD1.prepare type:', typeof mockD1.prepare);
        // console.log('Test File - mockD1.prepare is mock:', jest.isMockFunction(mockD1.prepare));
        ```

3.  **Alternative Injection/Mocking for D1:**
    *   If `process.env.DB` proves unreliable, consider other ways to provide the mock D1 to the handler in a test environment, e.g., by directly mocking the module that provides D1 if it's not a direct environment binding, or using dependency injection patterns if the code supports it. However, for Cloudflare Workers D1, environment binding is common.

### Other Outstanding Issues (Once Blocker is Resolved):

1.  **D1 Error Handling (500 vs 200):**
    *   Tests `should return 500 if D1 database operation fails during SELECT/INSERT` were receiving HTTP 200 instead of 500. This needs to be re-evaluated once `DB.prepare` is callable. The API's `try...catch` block should handle promise rejections from D1 calls.

2.  **"Prevent Claiming Twice" Logic:**
    *   Test `should prevent a user from claiming first play free credit twice` was failing `expect(res.body.success).toBe(false)` (receiving `true`). This also needs re-evaluation once `DB.prepare` is callable and its specific D1 mock can be confirmed to be active.

### Current State of Files:
*   `src/pages/api/first-play-free.ts`: Updated D1 database instance selection logic to prioritize `process.env.DB` in test environments. Removed `declare module 'jsonwebtoken';`.
*   `tests/integration/first-play-free.test.ts`:
    *   Refined `jsonwebtoken` mock.
    *   Refined `beforeEach` to use `jest.resetAllMocks()` and re-initialize mocks and critical `process.env` variables (including `process.env.DB = mockD1`).
    *   Tests expecting JWT success use unique token strings and explicit `mockReturnValueOnce` for `jwt.verify`.
    *   The "401 test" (`should return 401 if JWT is invalid`) is currently un-commented and uses `mockImplementationOnce`.
    *   The "prevent claiming twice" test has a more detailed D1 mock setup.

The primary blocker is ensuring the API handler uses the test-defined `mockD1` object with a functional `prepare` method.
