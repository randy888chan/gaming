> This is a mirrored repo from the [gamba monorepo](https://github.com/gamba-labs/gamba/tree/main/apps/demo).

A demo frontend featuring multiple casino games built on Gamba.

Simply provide your own wallet address to the `<Gamba />` provider and start collecting fees on every bet made on your platform.

## Quick Setup

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/gamba-labs/platform/generate).

2. [Connect your forked repo and deploy on Vercel](https://vercel.com/new).

3. Set up your Environment variables in the .env file. (Use .env.example as reference)

## Rewritten in Next.js

This version of the Gamba Demo has been rewritten using Next.js instead of Vite for improved performance and functionality.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Implementation

This platform includes a comprehensive security implementation with the following features:

- **Authentication & Authorization** - Particle Network JWT verification
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling** - Standard and sensitive rate limiting
- **Input Validation & Sanitization** - Comprehensive input validation
- **Database Security** - SQL injection prevention
- **Security Monitoring & Auditing** - Event logging and dashboard
- **Performance Monitoring** - API performance tracking

For detailed information about the security implementation, see [SECURITY.md](./docs/SECURITY.md).

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

This platform includes performance optimizations to improve user experience and reduce load times:

- **Bundle Analysis** - Using `@next/bundle-analyzer` to identify optimization opportunities
- **Code Splitting** - Dynamic imports with lazy loading for game components
- **Caching Strategy** - HTTP caching headers and Next.js caching optimizations
- **Tree Shaking** - Removal of unused code
- **Image Optimization** - Next.js Image component for automatic optimization

For detailed information about performance optimizations, see [PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md](./docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md).

### Performance Analysis Commands

```bash
# Analyze both server and browser bundles
npm run analyze

# Analyze only server bundle
npm run analyze:server

# Analyze only browser bundle
npm run analyze:browser
```

## ü§ñ Stigmergy Integration

This project is integrated with Stigmergy for AI-powered development coordination.

### Quick Start

1. **Start Stigmergy**: `npm run stigmergy:start`
2. **Use with Roo Code**: The MCP server (`mcp-server.js`) enables seamless integration
3. **Coordinate tasks**: Use natural language commands through Roo Code for project coordination

### Commands

- `npm run stigmergy:start` - Start Stigmergy for this project
- `npm run stigmergy:stop` - Stop Stigmergy processes
- `npm run mcp:test` - Test MCP server functionality

### Configuration

- Global settings: `/Users/user/.stigmergy/.env`
- Project overrides: `.env.stigmergy.example` (copy to `.env` to activate)

The integration works universally without requiring project-specific modifications.
## üè• Stigmergy Health Check

Run a comprehensive health check of your Stigmergy installation:

```bash
stigmergy validate
```

Or use the convenience script:

```bash
./stigmergy-health.sh
```
