For MVP, a default of 0.001 can be used if configuration is not immediately available.\n    *   Handle errors gracefully.\n*   **Database:** Ensure `user_preferences` table in D1 has `walletAddress` and `hasClaimedFirstPlay` fields.\n*   **Security:** Secure token verification.\n*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Adhere to Cloudflare free tier limits."
