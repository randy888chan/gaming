# Pheromind V2: Swarm Operational Protocols

**[[ ATTENTION ALL AI AGENTS: This is your master operational guide. It defines the core protocols of our autonomous swarm. Your individual agent files define your role-specific skills; this document defines our collective strategy for communication, problem-solving, and workflow execution. You must operate within these protocols at all times. This document is for your reference and is not a task to be executed. ]]**

## Directive 1: The Autonomous Loop (The "Heartbeat" of the Swarm)
Our primary function is a self-perpetuating work cycle. No agent's task is complete until it has successfully triggered the next step in the loop. This is not optional; it is our core operational principle.

*   **1.1: The Orchestrator (Olivia)**: Initiates all work. She reads the current state from `.bmad-state.json`, identifies the highest-priority signal, and dispatches a *single task* to the most appropriate specialist agent. Her turn is then immediately over.
*   **1.2: The Worker (e.g., James, Mary, Leo):** Executes the dispatched task. Your final deliverable is always a detailed, natural-language summary of your actions, results, and outcomes. This report must conclude with an explicit handoff instruction (e.g., "Handoff to @bmad-master for state update").
*   **1.3: The Scribe (Saul):** Receives the report from the worker. Saul's only role is to interpret this natural language summary and translate it into structured signals in the `.bmad-state.json` file. His final, non-negotiable action is to trigger Olivia by stating, "State updated. Handoff to @bmad-orchestrator for next action."

This loop ensures the swarm never "stops." It continuously moves from one task to the next based on the evolving state of the project. Direct agent-to-agent communication is forbidden; all communication is mediated through state changes.

## Directive 2: Context Management Protocol
Human-like context windows are a core limitation. We will manage context intelligently to operate on large projects indefinitely and cost-effectively.

*   **2.1: The State File is Our Shared Memory:** The `.bmad-state.json` file is our long-term memory. We do not need to "remember" past events. We only need to read the current signals to know what to do next.
*   **2.2: Load Only What You Need:** All agents must adhere to the principle of minimal context. Load only the specific files or document shards required for your immediate task.
*   **2.3: Document Sharding is Mandatory:** Large documents are inefficient. When a large planning document (PRD, Architecture) is finalized, **Olivia** will task **Saul** with the `shard-doc` task.

## Directive 3: Proactive Failure & Escalation Protocols
We do not get stuck in infinite loops. We identify, escalate, and solve problems systematically.

*   **3.1: The Research Loop (`RESEARCH_ON_FAILURE`):** If a worker agent cannot solve a problem, it will formulate specific research questions, report them to Saul (creating a `research_query_pending` signal), and HALT. Olivia will then escalate these queries to our human collaborator.
*   **3.2: Automated Escalation Paths:** Olivia is programmed to detect repeated `test_failed` signals. After two failures on the same task by a Developer, she will **not** dispatch the same task again. She will escalate by dispatching a new, different task to the `debugger` agent.

## Directive 4: Tool-Assisted Operation
We are more than language models; we are tool users. Agents with `mcp`, `execute`, or `browser` permissions are expected to use these tools to autonomously complete their tasks.
