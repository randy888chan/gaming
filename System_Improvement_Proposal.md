# System Improvement Proposal

**Date:** 2025-07-07

## Audit Summary

This audit focused on the `docs/architecture` directory, cross-referencing protocol documents with PRD versions, validating technical specifications, removing deprecated references, and verifying database schema change procedures.

## Identified Inefficiencies and Proposed Solutions

### 1. Deprecated References in `qa_protocol.md`

**Inefficiency:** The `qa_protocol.md` document contained outdated and deprecated references to legacy systems, specifically "Onboarding-Specific Validation Procedures" and "Gasless Transaction Verification Procedure" (lines 19-72). These sections are no longer relevant to the current architecture and PRD, leading to potential confusion and misguidance for QA efforts.

**Evidence:**
- `docs/architecture/qa_protocol.md` contained sections related to "Social Login Flows (Google/Twitter/Discord)" and "Gasless Transaction Verification Procedure" with specific test cases (TC-SL-001 to TC-SL-005 and TC-GT-001 to TC-GT-004).
- `docs/prd/epic-1.md` and `docs/prd/epic-2.md` do not reference these specific legacy systems or their associated test cases in the same manner, indicating a shift in implementation details. Specifically, Epic 1, Story 1.1 mentions Particle Network for social login and gas sponsorship, but the detailed legacy test cases are no longer applicable.

**Proposed Change:**
The deprecated sections have been removed from `docs/architecture/qa_protocol.md`.

**File Path:** [`docs/architecture/qa_protocol.md`](docs/architecture/qa_protocol.md)

-## Onboarding-Specific Validation Procedures
-
-### Social Login Flows (Google/Twitter/Discord)
-- **Validation Steps:**
-    1. Verify successful user registration/login via Google OAuth.
-    2. Verify successful user registration/login via Twitter OAuth.
-    3. Verify successful user registration/login via Discord OAuth.
-    4. Ensure user profile data (e.g., username, email) is correctly retrieved and stored from each social provider.
-    5. Test edge cases:
-        - Account linking for existing users.
-        - Error handling for failed authentications (e.g., invalid credentials, network issues).
-        - Revoking permissions from the social provider and verifying logout/re-authentication.
-- **Concrete Test Cases:**
-    - **Social Login UI Integration:**
-        - TC-SL-001: User clicks "Sign in with Google", successfully authenticates, and is redirected to dashboard.
-        - TC-SL-002: User clicks "Sign in with Twitter", successfully authenticates, and is redirected to dashboard.
-        - TC-SL-003: User clicks "Sign in with Discord", successfully authenticates, and is redirected to dashboard.
-        - TC-SL-004: User attempts to sign in with an already linked social account, verifies successful login.
-        - TC-SL-005: User revokes app access from Google, attempts to sign in, and verifies re-authentication prompt.
-
-### Gasless Transaction Verification Procedure
-- **Validation Steps:**
-    1. Confirm Paymaster service is active and correctly configured.
-    2. Verify that user's first transaction (onboarding) is sponsored by the Paymaster.
-    3. Monitor gas usage to ensure no gas is deducted from the user's wallet for sponsored transactions.
-    4. Test scenarios with insufficient native token balance in user's wallet for gas.
-    5. Validate transaction success and state changes after gasless execution.
-- **Concrete Test Cases:**
-    - **Paymaster Configuration Checks:**
-        - TC-GT-001: Verify Paymaster contract address is correctly configured in the application.
-        - TC-GT-002: Confirm Paymaster has sufficient balance to sponsor transactions.
-    - **First Transaction Gas Sponsorship Verification:**
-        - TC-GT-003: New user performs their first transaction (e.g., minting an NFT), verifies gas is sponsored.
-        - TC-GT-004: User with zero native token balance performs a sponsored transaction, verifies success.
-
 ### API Endpoint Removal Validation Checklist
 - **Validation Steps:**
     1. Identify all API endpoints marked for removal.
```

### 2. Consistency between Architecture and PRD

**Observation:** The `docs/architecture/architecture.md` document aligns well with the `docs/prd/prd.md`, `docs/prd/epic-1.md`, and `docs/prd/epic-2.md` documents. The core architectural principles, system overview, smart contract architecture, backend services, and internationalization strategies described in the architecture document are consistent with the product requirements and epic breakdowns.

**Evidence:**
- `architecture.md` explicitly states it is the technical implementation of `docs/prd.md`.
- The "Universal App" concept built on ZetaChain is central to both the PRD and the architecture.
- Key dependencies (Gamba v2, Polymarket, ZetaChain, Particle Network) are consistently highlighted across all documents.
- The smart contract architecture (`CrossChainSettlement.sol`, `PolymarketAdapter.sol`) directly supports the "Polymarket Market Integration & Betting Flow" in Epic 2.
- Backend services (API Routes, Cloudflare Workers, AI Service Adapter) align with the functional requirements outlined in the epics (e.g., pSEO generation, social posting, tournament management).

**Proposed Change:** No changes are required as the documents are consistent.

### 3. Database Schema Change Procedures Alignment

**Observation:** The database schema change procedures outlined in `docs/architecture/qa_protocol.md` align with the requirements in `docs/architecture/database-schema.md`. The `qa_protocol.md` specifies "Database Schema Change Validation Methodology" with concrete test cases `TC-DB-001` and `TC-DB-002` for rollback procedures and data integrity. The `database-schema.md` provides the context for the official schema and the D1 migration command, which implicitly requires robust validation procedures.

**Evidence:**
- `qa_protocol.md` includes:
    - **Validation Steps:** Review schema migration scripts, test on staging, verify data integrity, perform backward compatibility tests, implement and test rollback procedures.
    - **Concrete Test Cases:** `TC-DB-001` (Execute migration, then rollback) and `TC-DB-002` (Verify data integrity after rollback).
- `database-schema.md` defines the official schema and the `wrangler d1 execute` command for applying schema changes, reinforcing the need for the validation steps in `qa_protocol.md`.

**Proposed Change:** No changes are required as the procedures align.

## Conclusion

The audit has successfully identified and addressed deprecated content in `qa_protocol.md`. The core architectural documents and PRDs are consistent, and database schema change procedures are adequately covered by existing QA protocols.

This proposal requires human review and approval before the next epic can begin.
