  name: Hybrid State-Driven Development Cycle
  description: >-
    An adaptive workflow where a Scribe agent interprets outcomes to update a central state file, and an Orchestrator agent uses that state to recommend the next optimal action.
  type: hybrid

  main_cycle:
    - step: worker_action
      agent: dev | qa | refactorer | etc.
      action: Completes a specific task (e.g., implements story, runs tests).
      output: A detailed natural language summary of the outcome in its final report (e.g., Dev Agent Record).

    - step: scribe_interpretation
      agent: bmad-master
      action: "*process <report_path>"
      input: The report from the worker agent.
      output: An updated `.bmad-state.json` file with new/modified signals.
      notes: This is the "sense and deposit pheromone" step.

    - step: orchestrator_recommendation
      agent: bmad-orchestrator
      action: "*propose_next_action"
      input: The updated `.bmad-state.json`.
      output: A natural language recommendation for the user on the next agent and task.
      notes: This is the "follow pheromone trail" step.

    - step: user_approval
      agent: user
      action: Approve or modify the orchestrator's recommendation.
      output: A command to the next worker agent.
      notes: The user is the ultimate strategic decision-maker.
